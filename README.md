# Dependencies
`vpython`  
`python 3+`

# Todo:
- create functions
  - ~~make box~~
  - ~~make sphere~~
- location data
  - research ecosystems and how it affects wildlife
- create base "monster" with simple boxes
- work to automate the above functionality and add randomness 
- incorporate ecosystem features into monster creation ^  
- add different body types (pick randomly)  
  - quadapretal
  - tailed animals
  - bipedal animals
  - winged animals



# Ideas:
- could use the spheres as joints and then create movement from there (dont really need that rn for a poc but could explore in future)
